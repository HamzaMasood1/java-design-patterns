# Abstract Factory

## Also known as

Kit

## Intent

Provide an interface for creating families of related or dependent
objects without specifying their concrete classes.

## Explanation

Real world example

> To create weaponry and armour in gaming we need objects with a common theme. Weaponry and armour have many levels. For example, swords can be in bronze, silver, platinum or diamond. The same can be said for a helmet, chestplate, leggings, and boots.

In plain words

> A factory of factories; a factory that groups the individual but related/dependent factories together without specifying their concrete classes.

Wikipedia says

> The abstract factory pattern provides a way to encapsulate a group of individual factories that have a common theme without specifying their concrete classes
